- when you double click on a node, it makes that the current node. Lets you jump around the graph.
- a more robust description of the 510k process, medical devices and what this project is.
- a separate research tab that computes some cool stats on the graph.
    - largest subgraph
    - longest path by edges
    - longest path by time
    - nodes with most outgoing edges
    - node with most outgoing edges to different companies
    - subgraphs with the most nodes in the last year
- a separate leaderboard tab for the person who has been contact on the most devices
    - # of devices
    - most devices / timerange
    - most devices within last 10 years
    - longest time between first and last device

- allow searching by summary text using embeddings
    - find devices with cool tech stacks and keywords
