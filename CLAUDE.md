Documentation:'
- Put all of our core documents, learnings underneath a `docs` folder in the root of the project
- use markdown to write documentation

Coding:
- Use python as the core programming language.
- Use uv as the python package manager.
- Use python 3.14 (pi) as the version
- Prefer flatter projects over nested ones. Use separate files instead of nested folders to keep it simple
- Use python3 typehints for everything.
- Use pydantic for storing key datastructures in the project and for adding validation
- keep docstrings succinct and to the point.
- When running code use `uv run <script>.py`
